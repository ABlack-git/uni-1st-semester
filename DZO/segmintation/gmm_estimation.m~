function [priors, means, covs] = gmm_estimation(x, c)
% Estimate Gaussian mixture model (GMM) by maximizing the likelihood.
% The input is formed by sample vectors split to clusters. Each cluster
% corresponds to one GMM component. The output is formed by estimated prior
% probabilities, mean vectors and covariance matrices for all components.
%
% Input:
%   x [DxN (double)] N data sample vectors of dimension D from which GMM
%     should be estimated
%   c [1xN (double)] identifier of the cluster to which the corresponding
%     sample is assigned; there are totally K = max(c) clusters which are
%     named as 1, 2, ..., k
%
% Output:
%   priors [1xK (double)] prior probabilities of individual GMM components
%   means [DxK (double)] mean vectors of individual GMM components
%   covs [DxDxK (double)] covariance matrices of individual GMM components
